### Installation (for development)

TRACLE requires Python3 and pip3, if you are running Linux you probably have it already installed, otherwise refer to the documentation of your distribution on how to install it.

First, clone, fork or download this repository.
Open a terminal and change your working directory to the root of the repository, e.g.

```
git clone https://github.com/TeamTracle/tracle.git
cd tracle
```
Next, create a virtual environment and activate it. I recommend [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), e.g.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

We use pip-tools to manage the requirements.txt, so install that, too:
```
pip3 install pip-tools
```

Next, install the dependencies from requirements.txt and requirements_dev.txt:
```
pip3 install wheel
pip-sync requirements.txt requirements_dev.txt
```

Create a file called `.env` with the following content:

```
export DEBUG=1
export BUNNYCDN_ENABLED=0
export INSTALLED_APPS="debug_toolbar" # optional
```

Setup the database:

```
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata backend/fixtures/categories.json
```

You can run a local development server using the following command:

```
./manage.py runserver
```

Autoprefixer is run only on deployment or when DEBUG is set to false. You'll need npm to install these node modules:

```
npm install -g postcss-cli autoprefixer
```
